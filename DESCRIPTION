Description: This proof of concept R-package comes with a fully specified conda environment
  that will be created when the R package is installed. All Python code inside this package
  will then be run in this conda environment. We can ship several models in the same R package
  as long as they share their conda environment. If two models do not share their conda
  environment, we ship them in separate R packages.
